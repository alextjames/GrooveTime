GrooveTime allows you to control groove shark from a remote device through a light weight web interface. It's made up of two parts:

    - The python script which is a web server. It needs to be invoked with the first argument being a hostname or ip which can be reached by any computer you'd like to remotely control grooveshark with.
    - The second part is a greasemonkey(firefox) or tampermonkey(chrome) which is meant to run on the brower with groove shark open. This must be the same computer running the python script.

*****
* Requirements
*****

    - You must have the python libraries bottle installed.
    - The brower running groove shark needs greasemonkey or tampermonkey installed, and the included user script enabled.

* Instructions

GrooveTime is simply to use, just run the included python script. On the same computer run groove shark in a browser with the included plugin installed. Connect to the server on port 8080 on your remote device and let the good times roll.
